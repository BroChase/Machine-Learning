Program 3: Naive Bayes BGD-LR SGD-LR

***Description**
Implementation of Naive Bayes BGD-LR and SGD-LR
Use of a dataset containing 19x19png images of faces and non-faces the goal of the program is to use Naive Bayes BGD-LR and SGD-LR to
evaluate the dataset.
End result is the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 scores, along with ROC curves for each measure and a combined ROC graph.

***To Run***
Py Files:
facerecog.py
dataproc.py
BGlogisticReg.py
nbclassifier.py
metrics.py
stochasticlogicregression.py

Face and non-face file paths must be changed to local running machines path.  See notes in facerecog.py

run facerecog.py 'main'

Program:
Python 3.6
Written with Pycharm 2017 IDE on a Windows 10 OS PC.
requires:
numpy, matplotlib, pandas
